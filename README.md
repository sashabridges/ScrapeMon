# ScrapeMon
Using the following websites:
https://www.serebii.net/
and
https://www.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/
we will scrape data for ~100 Pokemon.

Then, after scraping the data off of both websites, we will put the accumulated data into two dictionaries.
After that, we will transform the dictionaries into DataFrames.
Finally, we will turn the DataFrames into SQL or NoSQL tables.
